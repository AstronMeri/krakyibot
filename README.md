🤖 Krakyi Bot

Krakyi is a Node.js-powered Twitter bot that replies to mentions with AI-generated Ghanaian Pidgin memes — complete with custom image responses.

It combines humor, local flavor, and technical resilience with:

🧠 Multi-layer AI fallback: OpenAI → Cohere → Gemini → Static Pidgin replies

🎨 Image generation: DALL·E → Gemini Vision → Stability.ai

🗣️ Language style: Ghanaian Pidgin with punchy, culturally relevant humor

🔥 Always-on: Uses long-polling to monitor tweets and reply in real time

📦 Firebase for logging, rate limits, and error tracking
